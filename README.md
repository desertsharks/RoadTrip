##Road Trip Overview
After selecting Road Trip end points, top destinations evenly populate along your route.

Several options for the type of destinations are available from the drop-down menu.

If any of the Top Ten destinations are less appealing, X'ing them will automatically select
the next ranked attraction.

##Features
The attractions at the origin and destination are intentionally omitted for a radius of 20 miles, unless
the route itself is shorter than this distance.
